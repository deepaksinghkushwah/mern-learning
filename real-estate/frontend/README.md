RealEstate Frontend
-------------------

This app use NodeJS + MongoDB as backend. You can create properties, login/logout, search/paginate in properties area. Created simple dashboard which is only accessible to logged in users. Only admin role users can add/edit properties. Delete properties not implemented.

I have used 'Zustand' for state management. 'Bootstrap' for UI components and 'FakerJS' to generate fake data for properties.

I have used 'pnpm' and 'vite' to create this frontend.


Run following commands to run project (check package.json for more commands)
